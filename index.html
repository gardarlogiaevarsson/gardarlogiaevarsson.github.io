			<h2>campaign</h2>
			<hr>
			<h3>character and setting</h3>
			<p>The game is set five years following the destructive Battle of Demeter in the original Titanfall. The Militia have gained significant ground in the Frontier War, and IMC forces are on the defensive. The Militia's campaign leads them to the IMC world of Typhon, the planet that serves as the central focus of the game's story. The player plays as the Militia Rifleman Jack Cooper, as he is forced to become a Pilot against all odds. The Titan BT-7274 serves as the deuteragonist of the game.</p>

			<h3>the future of titanfall</h3>
			<p>currently the future of the game is not looking good as the game has bean hacked and dedosed and it dosent look like respawn entertainment is doing anything about it so some players have took it into they're own hands by making a mod for the game so others can host they're own server but that of course means the others that dont have the ability to host they're own server gotta play on other and those may be modded and dont have a proper anti cheat</p>

		<h2>titans</h2>
		<p>Titans have had a significant gameplay change since the first game. Instead of fully-customisable loadouts like those of Pilots, Titans are now based on six class archetypes (Seven, as of Monarch's Reign). These archetypes each have a unique class weapon, tactical/ utility ability, Core Ability, Ordnance and defensive ability. In addition, Electric Smoke - a defensive ability selectable in lieu of another in Titanfall - is now a standard ability available to all Titans.</p>
		<h3>titan classes</h3>
		<p>The six launch Titan classes are Ion, Scorch, Northstar, Ronin, Tone and Legion. A seventh, Monarch, was added in Monarch's Reign. Ion and Tone are based on the Atlas Titan, Scorch and Legion are based on the Ogre and Northstar and Ronin are based on Stryder. Monarch is based on the Vanguard, seen in the campaign, but in practicality has the same stats as the Atlas Titans</p>

			<h2>Titanfall 2</h2>
			<p>Titanfall 2 is a science-fiction first-person shooter video game and a sequel to Titanfall. It was developed by Respawn Entertainment and was released on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows on October 28, 2016. It was released on Steam on June 18, 2020.</p>

			<h2>gameplay</h2>
			<hr>
			<h3>pilot gameplay</h3>
			<p>Pilot gameplay follows the same basic lines as the first game, in regards to basic mechanics. However, the health of players has been drastically lowered, and Time-To-Kill (TTK) is much lower than the first, making fast reflexes more of a priority. A new mechanic, sliding, has also been added. Crouching while sprinting or otherwise moving will allow the user to slide across the ground for a short time, preserving momentum and allowing for slide-hops for quick traversal of the arena.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>weapons</h3>
			<p>The armory of Titanfall 2 was greatly expanded since the first game. On launch, Titanfall 2 had 20 Pilot Primary weapons and 8 Pilot secondary weapons. Unlike the first game, which featured primary weapons, secondary weapons and an Anti-Titan weapon, the AT and Sidearm roles were now in the same category, and choosing one meant sacrificing the other, allowing a trade-off between specialty and versatility. This secondary weapon category included 4 sidearms and 4 AT weapons. Of these weapons, every single Titanfall weapon returned in some form or another (The R-101C Carbine replaced with the R-201 Assault Rifle, the G2A4 Battle Rifle replaced with the G2A5 Battle Rifle etc). After the game's launch, two weapons were added through DLC; the B3 Wingman Elite and R-101C Carbine. Of particular note is the Smart Pistol. Due to its reputation amongst the playerbase, the Smart Pistol has now been relegated to a one-use Boost, as opposed to a loadout weapon. As of The War Games DLC, Sidearms and Anti-Titan weapons are no longer mutually exclusive, and a player is now free to wield a Primary, Sidearm and AT weapon in the same loadout just like Titanfall. As of the Tricks and Treats update, the B3 Wingman Elite and SA-3 Mozambique have now been changed to primary weapons, bringing the total number of primary options up to 23.</p>
